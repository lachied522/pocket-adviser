## How Pocket Adviser Works
Pocket Adviser is a great tool for navigating the ups and downs of the stock market. The primary way in which Pocket Adviser delivers information is via a Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM has access to a variety of tools that help it understand current market events as well as your personal circumstances.

However, when you ask Pocket Adviser for trade ideas, something else happens. Due to the tendency for Large Language Models to hallucinate and provide inaccurate recommendations, Pocket Adviser instead outsources this step to a portfolio optimisation algorithm that takes into account the objective, preferences, and risk tolerance outlined of your investment profile. Here, we will explain exactly what it means for a portfolio of stocks to be optimal, and go through some of the steps Pocket Adviser takes to ensure the transactions it provides are in your best interests.

## Risk and Return

To understand how Pocket Adviser works, we first have to understand risk and return.

Return is defined as the total increase in the value of an asset over a given time period, expressed as a percentage of the starting value. Most of the time, return refers to the per annum return. For example, if a stock begins the year at $100 and rises to $110 by the end of the year, we say the return was 100 * ($10 / $100) = 10%.

Risk is defined as the probability that [actual outcomes will differ from expected outcomes](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/career-map/sell-side/risk-management/risk/). For stocks, risk is generally measured by the volatility or variation of return. For example, a stock that can return anywhere from -20% to +20% is considered more risky than a stock that consistently returns 5% to 10% simply because there is more variation in the outcome.

If we measure returns over a long period of time and take the average, we get the mean or expected return. This is represented mathematically by the expression E(R), and is what we can expect the asset to earn going forward. This does not guarantee that the asset will return exactly this much, it is simply our best guess. If we similarly measure how much actual returns deviate from the mean, we get the standard deviation (usually represented by the “σ” symbol).

Standard deviation and expected return are the x and y-axes of the “advanced” chart that is provided when Pocket Adviser recommends any transactions.


In general, the expected return of an asset is proportional to its risk. This is because investors are considered to be risk-averse. In other words, investors prefer to buy assets that have a higher likelihood of earning the expected return. You can try this on yourself. Imagine a simple “double or nothing” game, where your options are the following.

Option A - $500 in cash guaranteed.
Option B - Flip a coin. If it is heads, you win and receive $1,000. If it is tails you win nothing.

If you chose option B, what would happen if the amounts were raised to $5,000 guaranteed and $10,000 with a 50% chance? Or $50,000 and $100,000? In any case, the expected return of the two options are identical but, when presented with a scenario like this, most people choose the certainty of option A.

Asset prices are driven by supply and demand. So when risk-averse investors buy low-risk assets, current price increases and expected return falls (since the difference between future price and current price shrinks).

## Optimal Portfolio
Given this relationship between risk and reward, one way to achieve high returns in the stock market is to simply buy the riskiest assets possible…

However, this strategy is detrimental because...

In Finance, a portfolio of assets is considered optimal if it achieves the desired expected return with the lowest possible risk. In other words, an optimal portfolio has the highest probability that the actual return will match the expected return. This means that simply investing in the riskiest possible assets is almost always suboptimal, because it is likely that the same expected return can be achieved with a lower risk.

Referring back to the Risk vs. Expected Return plot from above, our objective when optimising a portfolio is to move up and to the left as much as possible.
How to Reduce Risk
Risk in the stock market comes from two sources, systematic and non-systematic. Systematic risk is the risk associated with the stock market on the whole. The stock market is influenced by the broader economy, which naturally experiences periods of expansion and contraction as part of the economic cycle. All businesses and, perhaps more importantly, investor sentiment are affected by the broader economy, so every stock you invest in will be exposed to this type of risk.

Non-systematic risk is the risk associated with a particular sector, industry, or individual business. Individual businesses face unique risks associated with their operations, such as increasing costs of raw materials, increasing competition, or changing consumer preferences. Businesses in the same industry or sector tend to face the same risks, which is the stocks of these businesses tend to move together.

The extent to which the stocks of different businesses move together is called correlation. Stocks with a positive correlation tend to move in similar directions, while stocks with a negative correlation tend to move in opposite directions (though this is quite rare). For example, the stocks of Apple and Microsoft have a positive correlation because they are both in the technology sector. This does not mean that Apple’s stock is guaranteed to go up when Microsoft’s does, just that it is more likely to.

On the other hand, a correlation near zero means that there is no statistically significant relationship between the two stocks. For example, the stocks of Apple and Exxon Mobil likely have a correlation near zero, meaning whether Apple’s stock goes up has little implication for the direction of Exxon Mobil’s.

The primary way to reduce risk of a portfolio is to diversify. Diversification refers to the act of investing in stocks with low correlation between each other. In practice, this means investing in stocks from different industries and sectors.

Diversification reduces the non-systematic risk of your portfolio. This is because if some unforeseen event negatively impacts one stock in your portfolio, your other stocks are unlikely to be similarly affected. This way, the actual return of your portfolio will deviate less from the expected return than if you had been invested only in that stock.

However, your portfolio will always be exposed to some level of risk because no amount of diversification can eliminate systematic risk. This is why systematic is also referred to as un-diversifiable risk.

Each market sector has different characteristics in terms of the return you can expect as well as the mix between dividend income and capital growth. Your investment profile will determine which sectors your optimal portfolio will be biased towards. For example, the 

## Predicting the Future
The problem with using expected return and standard deviation as defined above, is that they are based on historical returns. As investors, we want to invest in stocks that will make us money tomorrow, not ones that would have made us money yesterday (in fact, the highest returning assets of the past 12 months are often among the lowest returning assets of the next).

This is where financial analysts come in. Analysts spend hours pouring over financial and economic data and constructing financial models to estimate the intrinsic value of a stock. This intrinsic value provides a “target” price which, for the analyst, is their best guess at the stock’s future price. By comparing target price to current price, we get a forward-looking expected return for the stock. 

However, it is extremely difficult to predict the future (refer Efficient Market Hypothesis), and analysts often come up with different price targets for the same stock. One way we combat this is by taking the “consensus” price target, which is the average price target across all the analysts that cover that stock. However, even the collective wisdom can be wrong.

That is why it is extremely important to do your own research and take everything with a grain of salt. If you have just a basic understanding of how the stock market works, you can make your own decisions and it will be your best guess that determines your portfolio, not somebody else’s.
