## What is a stock?
A stock, or share, is a type of financial security that represents part ownership of a business.

This means you are given all the rights and benefits that come with owning a business, including participating and voting in AGMs, receiving reports and other information, and receiving dividends.

By voting, you genuinely have a say in important decisions the business has to make. However, most of the time individual investors like you and I simply do not hold enough shares to influence the outcome of votes. It is usually large shareholders such as hedge funds or the founders themselves that influence the outcome. Voting is optional. Personally, I have never bothered to vote in an AGM, but feel free to do so if that's what floats your boat!

When businesses start their lives they are usually private, meaning it is owned by a small number of people, usually its founders, venture capitalists, or angel investors, and shares are not available to purchase publicly. Think of your local cafe or restaurant. Many businesses stay private because it affords the owners tighter control, incurs lower administration costs, and does not subject them to public scrutiny.

When businesses become large enough, they have the option to go public with an event called an **Initial Public Offering (IPO)** or float. At the IPO, the owners of the company sell their shares to the public, including you and I. Companies do this to broaden their investor base and raise more capital (a fancy word for money) than would typically be accessible privately. It also provides the opportunity for **secondary offerings**, where the company can raise more capital by choosing to sell more shares to the public after the IPO.

However, going public doesn't come without its downsides. Once they decide to go public, companies must meet many regulatory obligations, including the obligation to disclose financial and other information to the market on a regular basis. These obligations incur material cost to the business. Additionally, the company becomes subject to public scrutiny and management must cater to the concerns of a wide range of investors.

The IPO and any secondary offerings are the only times investors buy shares directly from the company. This is called the **primary market**. In these cases, the money from investors goes straight to the company's balance sheet. Every other time you buy shares, you are buying them from another investor. This is called the **secondary market**.

If the company does not make or lose money from the secondary market, why should it care about its share price? Companies like to reward their shareholders for investing in them. If shareholders feel rewarded, investing in the company is more appealing and the company can potentially raise more through future secondary offerings. Additionally, managers' compensation is usually tied to the performance of the company's stock, whether through bonuses or stock-based compensation. If not for their compensation, managers want the stock to perform well because it is one of the yardsticks used to assess their competence and they could potentially be fired because of it.

## Stocks versus Bonds
Stocks are not the only way to invest. Stocks are just a piece of a much larger puzzle, and it is important to understand the part that stocks play from the perspective of both businesses and investors.

Firstly, I want to introduce you to the asset class that is stocks' cousin - bonds.

Just like you or I can go to the bank to get a loan, companies can raise money by issuing bonds. Bonds are a type of security that represent an IOU from the company to the bondholder. Unlike shareholders, bondholders must be paid back the money they gave to the company, plus a fixed interest payment called a coupon.

You will see the terms "debt" and "equity" thrown around frequently in the finance world, and this course. The term "equity" means ownership in a company, and stocks are a type of equity security. On the other hand, "debt" refers to an obligation for one party to pay a sum of money to the other, which is exactly what a bond is.

Like stocks, bonds can be traded between investors on a secondary market. For some perspective, the global bond market is actually larger than the stock market. In 2022, the global bond market totalled US \$133 trillion compared to the equity market which totalled US \$122 trillion.

Bondholders have a fixed claim on the company's profits. No matter how much money the company makes, bondholders will receive the contracted interest payment as long as the company can afford it. On the other hand, shareholders have a residual claim on the company's profits, meaning they only receive what money is left after all other obligations are paid.

For this reason debt securities, like bonds, are less risky than stocks. You are far less likely to permanently lose your investment in bonds than in stocks. The choice between debt and equity investments has important implications for economic cycles and assessing market sentiment. For example, investors move their money from risky assets such as equities into safer ones such as bonds when they anticipate an economic slowdown. We will cover more later in this course.

## Risk versus Reward
> "High risk, high reward." - common expression in investing, and gambling...

Investors have many asset classes to choose from to invest in, including government and corporate bonds, real estate, private equity, and venture capital. Each of these options involves a different level of **risk**. Risk is defined as [the degree of uncertainty in the expected return of an investment](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/what-risk). For example, government bonds are considered among the safest investments because it is virtually guaranteed that you will receive the return promised (governments can always print more money if they run out). On the other end of the spectrum is venture capital, which involves investing in startups and smaller companies. This involves a higher level of **risk** because these businesses are unproven and unprofitable, and there is a high degree of uncertainty about whether they ever will be.

Humans are generally risk averse, meaning we prefer to make choices where we can be certain about the outcome. To see what I mean imagine you are presented with two options where the expected return is identical.
- Option A - flip a coin and receive \$1100 if it lands on tails and lose \$1000 if not.
- Option B - receive \$50 right now.

<CoinFlipper />

Even though the expected outcome is the same, the certainty of the \$50 in Option B seems more attractive that in Option A due to the possibility of losing \$1000. If you don't feel this way, what if each of the values were multiplied by 100 or 1000?

A risk averse investor will always choose Option B. In order to deviate from the safe choice and bear more risk the investor must receive a higher expected return to make up for the uncertainty involved.

## Capital Market Line
This effect can be seen by plotting expected return and risk of all the asset classes available to investors. The resulting trend is upwards and to the right, indicating that expected return is increasing with risk. The trendline plotted through the asset classes is called the **capital market line (CML)**.

![Capital Market Line](/education/capital-market-line.png)

You can see that stocks lie pretty far up on the line (which is important to know if you decide to invest in them, which I hope you do once you finish this course). So while the average return of the S&P 500 might be 10%, it has fallen as much 36% in some years (2008) and risen by 30+% in others.

![Stocks vs Bonds Performance](/education/stocks-bonds-performance.png)

When I first saw the capital market line I thought, "I'd like a high return, so all I have to do is invest in the riskiest assets!" By thinking this, I failed to see the ever increasing range of possible returns as you move from right to left along the CML.

For this reason, I think the above plot of the capital market line (which is the standard in finance textbooks) is misleading. A better plot would show all potential returns, not just the expected one.

![Range of Returns](/education/range-of-returns.png)

If the price of an asset tomorrow, or one year from now, was known to be signficantly higher than it is today, investors would simply buy into it and bid up the price until there was no longer any return to be earned. In other words, the risk-reward relationship exists precisely because we can never know for certain what will happen in the future.

> Key Concept - Making more money from investing requires you take on more risk and potentially lose more.

Risk, or uncertainty in outcome, is the price you pay for high returns. Earning outsized returns requires taking on some level of risk or uncertainty. But that does not mean simply taking on as much risk as possible is the answer. There is never a guarantee that the high return outcome is the one that eventuates. With increasing risk, the probability of experiencing negative outcomes also increases.

## Beta (β)
Beta (referring to the greek symbol, β) is an important concept that presents itself frequently in the financial world. It is a bit of a jargon-y term, but I think the idea is still important to understand. I will attempt to explain it using as little maths as possible, but if you are interested you can read more about [it and the Capital Asset Pricing Model here](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data-science/beta-coefficient/).

As we saw above, the investing world consists of many different asset classes. Each asset class involves a different level of risk and expectation for return. The portfolio that includes all available assets is called the market portfolio, and can be thought of as having average expected return and average risk. On the capital market line, the market portfolio lies somewhere in the middle.

Things like the economy and investor sentiment have wide-spread implications, so assets tend to rise and fall with the market portfolio. Riskier investments rise more than market in good times and fall more in bad times. Hence, riskier investments have a wider range of expected returns and appear higher on the capital market line. On the other hand, less risky investments move less than the market and appear lower on the capital market line.

Beta is the **correlation** between the movements of an asset and the market portfolio. If an asset has a Beta above 1.0, it means that, on average, the asset will rise more than the market portfolio in good times and fall more during bad times, and vice versa. An asset with a Beta above 1.0 appears above the market portfolio on the capital market line. We can therefore expect the asset will earn a higher return.

## Market Indeces
I have mentioned the S&P 500 a couple of times already without explaining what it is. The S&P 500 is one of the most popular market indeces. A market index is a hypothetical portfolio of assets that is used to track the performance of a particular sector of the market.

The S&P 500 tracks the performance of the 500 largest companies listed in the US. Stocks in the hypothetical portfolio are weighted according to the market capitalisation of the underlying company. For example, at the time of writing, [Apple (AAPL) is the largest company in the Index and has a weighting of 6.86%](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500).

There are different indices for different countries, as seen below.

The S&P 500 is commonly used as a proxy for the market portfolio. That is because the US stock market is the largest in the world, and the Index approximately represents the average portfolio across all participants in the market.

The S&P 500 is commonly used as a benchmark to compare the performance of other portfolios to. When you hear the phrase "beat the market," it is usually referring to outperforming the S&P 500. The average return of the S&P 500 is about 10%.

## Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
Beta provides a standardised way of measuring risk by comparing it to the market portfolio. This allows us to approximately measure the expected return of an investment based on its relationship to the market portfolio. We can calculate expected return mathematically with the following formula, called the capital asset pricing model formula (don't be alarmed by this formula, it will only be used to inform some of the concepts for the rest of this section).

> E(R) = R<sub>f</sub> + β<sub>i</sub>

In this formula, the risk-free rate is the expected return of a zero-risk investment. In practice, there is no zero-risk investment, however the [three-month US Treasury bill](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DTB3) is often considered the closest to a zero-risk investment.

The way to interpret this formula is that every investment should earn some minimum return (the risk-free rate), plus an incremental amount corresponding to the additional risk taken in proportion to the market portfolio. So, for example, if a stock has a Beta of 1.5 and the risk-free rate is 5.0%, we can expect the stock to return 5.0 + 1.5 * (10.0 - 5.0) = 12.5%.

This formula is by no means the secret to making money in stocks. It is highly simplistic and is derived from statistical relationships presented by historical data. It assumes that those historical relationships will continue to hold in the future, and has nothing to do with any of the fundamental, technical, or macroeconomic factors that truly determine returns. What it does do is provide an initial scope for what can be expected from a stock. For example, Woolworths (WOW) has a Beta of 0.25, indicating it is much less risky than the market so is unlikely to earn a 20%+ return. This does not mean it isn't possible if some the above-mentioned factors line up favourably.

This is where your personal investing objective and time horizon come in. If you have a long time horizon, you have time to ride out negative returns associated with risky investments if things turn bad. For this reason, the stocks you invest in should generally have high Betas so that you can earn a high average return over the long-term. Again, this does not mean that Beta is a criteria for selecting stocks.

## Systematic and Non-Systematic Risk
As mentioned, when macroeconomic factors effect the general market, assets tend to rise and fall correspondingly with the market portfolio. The risk, or fluctuations in price, arising from these factors is called systematic risk. However, these are not the only factors that determine returns.

Unsystematic risk is the risk that arises from company-specific factors, such as branding, innovation, competition, and earnings. These factors are not accounted for in the CAPM formula above, and can cause returns to deviate from those implied by the general market.

## Summary of Key Concepts
- Assets with a higher degree of uncertainty earn a higher return over the long-term.
- Making more money from investing requires you take on more risk.
