## Reading the Income Statement
The income statement is arranged with revenue at the top, with expenses and other costs listed in order of significance. The money can be seen as trickling down from revenue at the top, with a little bit going each to each line underneath, all the way to net income at the bottom. Related items are grouped together and the lines relating to a sum are often underlined.

You will see how the underlined items are equal to the sum of the ones above. Using Apple's income statement as an example, we can see that the Gross Income for June (\$39,678 million) is equal to Net Sales (\$85,777 million) minus Total Cost of Sales (\$46,099 million).

We can then use this sum to help us calculate some of the items below it. For example, Operating Income is equal to Gross Income (\$39,678 million) minus Total Operating Expenses (\$14,326 million), which is \$25,352 million.

It is worthwhile to note that some companies use different terminology to describe the same thing. For example, in Apple has decided to use "gross margin" to describe what I would refer to as gross profit. "Margin" usually refers to a percentage, like in profit margin (see below). This just means that you will sometimes have to intuit what the item is referring to.

## Analysing the Income Statement
Earnings per share is arguably the single most important driver of share prices. As demonstrated in the chart below, share prices will always trend in the same direction as earnings per share over the long-term.

Earnings per Share (EPS) versus price return of Costco (COST)

Therefore, the first to do when analysing the balance sheet is to determine the overall trend in earnings per share. You want to see consistent and strong growth in EPS over time.

Earnings are determined by two things - revenue and costs. Earnings can be increased by either increasing revenue or reducing costs. However, costs cannot be cut forever, so we would clearly prefer to see earnings grow as a result of revenue increasing over time.

I like to think of revenue as a measure of demand or popularity. When revenue is growing over time it suggests demand for the company's product is increasing, which is exactly what we want. On the other hand, falling revenue suggests demand for the product is weakening, or it is falling out of fashion.

It is natural for costs to increase as the business grows. Some costs are even For example, research and development (R&D) is an investment in the future of the business. Whether it is researching consumer preferences, exploring new products, or improving existing ones products, the intent is to find ways to grow the business over the long-term.

It is even better if the rate of growth in both revenue and earnings is increasing over time. In other words, revenue and earnings are not only growing, but accelerating, over time. This type of growth is more common for newer businesses since sales are low to begin with. If earnings are decelerating it could mean that growth is plateauing and will not continue in the future. This is very common as businesses mature and it becomes harder to gain market share.

Revenue and, therefore, earnings are very often cyclical in nature, meaning they naturally fluctuate up and down with business conditions. For example, the revenue of mining companies like BHP or Rio Tinto (RIO) are directly influenced by the price of resources which can change significantly at different points in the cycle. Another example is retailers like Target (TGT), which experience greater sales during the December quarter because of the holiday season. In these situations it is not appropriate to compare revenue and earnings over short timeframes. That is why it is important to consider the trend over the long-term, like four to five years.

### Price to Earnings (PE) ratio

> Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price / Annual EPS

The PE ratio is the most widely used and quoted valuation metric. As the name implies, it is the ratio of share price to earnings per share. It represents how much investors are paying for every $1 the company earns. For example, a PE ratio of 20 means investors are paying $20 for every $1 the company earns. You can also think about it as the number of years it would take for a company to earn back its share price. In this example, if you purchase a share in this company it would take 20 years for the company to earn back your $20. The PE ratio is also called the earnings multiple, because it presents share price as a multiple of its earnings per share (EPS).

Earnings can be measured on a forward or trailing basis. Usually the PE ratio is quoted on a trailing basis, meaning it is calculated using EPS for the last 12 months (usually designated with the suffix TTM for Trailing Twelve Months). The forward PE ratio is calculated using estimates of EPS for the next 12 months.

The forward PE ratio is considered more relevant than the trailing PE ratio investors should be more concerned about what the company will make rather than what it has made in the past. However, estimates can be wrong. The trailing PE is more grounded, but makes the assumption that earnings will be similar in the future.

PE ratios rise and fall as investors try to anticipate how much money the company will make in the future. And investor perceptions are highly influenced by human emotion. When investors are optimistic, prices rise much more than the increase in earnings implied by whatever positive piece of news that was released. In this situation, PE ratios are inflated, indicating the stock is likely overvalued. On the other hand, when investors are fearful or pessimistic, prices fall much less than the implied decrease in earnings, PE ratios are lower, and the stock is likely undervalued.

> Key Concept - The PE ratio and earnings per share together explain 100% of movements in share price.

Above, we said that share price always follows earnings per share over the long-term. All other movements in share price can be explained by the relative optimism or pessimism that are captured by movements in the PE ratio. When EPS rises but price falls, the PE ratio necessarily contracts, and when EPS falls but price rises, the PE ratio necessarily expands.



Below you can see how the average (trailing) PE ratio across all the constituents of the S&P 500 Index has changed over time. At the time of writing, anything trading below a 30 PE ratio would be considered cheap. This is because investors are anticipating earnings to grow significantly in the future. According to S&P Global, the [forward PE ratio is much lower at 21.41](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/#data) which is closer to its historical level.

However, it is not always fair to compare the PE ratio of a company to the market average. Every company is different and earnings fluctuate up and down differently for each one. As you can see below, the average PE ratio varies significantly between market sectors.

![S&P 500 breakdown by sector](/education/sp500-sector-breakdown.png)

S&P 500 PE ratios and other metrics by sector

This is an important concept that will recur throughout this section. Because each company is different, all financial metrics or ratios should not be looked at in isolation but should be measured relative to similar companies or the sector average.

Another way to can assess the valuation is by looking at the PE ratio over time. Just like we did with the S&P 500 Index above, we can compare the current PE ratio the historical average to see whether the stock is cheaper compared to itself. This is great because single companies tend not to change significantly over time, which provides a setting that satisfies the "all else equal" problem.

### Price to Earnings Growth (PEG) Ratio

> PEG ratio = PE ratio / EPS growth rate (%)

Back in our example where the PE ratio is 20, investors are paying $20 for every $1 the company earns. But what if the company earns $2 next year, followed by $3 and $4 and so on? It will take much less than 20 years for the company to earn investors' money back. This company is clearly more valuable so it is reasonable for the PE ratio, which uses present earnings in its calculation, to be higher.

Key Concept - High expected growth rates should cause PE ratios to be higher.
The PEG ratio takes into account earnings growth to provide an easier metric to compare the valuation of companies. The PEG ratio may reveal companies that appear overpriced at first glance, but are actually cheap when growth is factored in. Likewise, companies that have a high PE ratio but are not growing as fast will have a higher PEG ratio and therefore appear more expensive.

The EPS growth rate in the denominator can come from historical earnings growth (a trailing basis), or estimated future earnings (a forward basis).

In general, you should look for a PEG ratio below or around 1.0. However, there are still factors other than growth that can effect valuation, so it is still important to compare the PEG ratio on a relative basis.

One of the shortcomings of the PEG ratio is that growth is not always positive. In fact, pretty much every company will experience negative growth at some point in its life. And when growth is negative the PEG ratio is negative, which has no meaning at all. This pretty much disqualifies the PEG ratio from being used in sectors where growth fluctuate, like energy or mining, and during economic downturns. However, in all other situations the PEG ratio is one of the best for assessing valuation.

### Price to Sales (PS) Ratio

> Price to Sales Ratio = Share Price / Annual Revenue per Share

The PE ratio does not work if earnings are negative, which is common for startups and younger companies. In this situation, the PE ratio becomes negative and loses its meaning. One way of dealing with this is to use the price to sales ratio instead.

The PS ratio is similar to the PE ratio, but has revenue per share instead of earnings per share in the denominator. This can be helpful in assessing younger companies because revenue is always positive. It can be used in all the same ways as the PE ratio.

You can see in the figure above how the average PS ratio is much greater for the real estate and technology sectors. This is because costs are much lower for these industries (lower costs, greater earnings, and higher share price).

However, this ratio does not take costs into account and therefore relates less closely to how much shareholders get to take home than the PE ratio does. For this reason, I would recommend only using the PS ratio as a stand-in when the PE ratio can't be used.

### Profit Margin

> Profit Margin = Net Income / Revenue

Profit margin is another measure of a company’s efficiency and profitability. It represents how much money the company gets to keep after all of its expenses. For example, a company with a profit margin of 30% keeps 30 cents for every $1 in revenue.

The higher the profit margin the better as it indicates the company is more efficient as it can generate the same level of earnings at a lower cost. Additionally, high profit margins provide a sort of cushion against market downturns. For example, because of the significant costs involved in maintaining a fleet of aircraft, the average profit margin in the airline industry is only 2.6%. So when revenue evaporated during Covid-19 these airlines lost billions of dollars. These low margins are why Warren Buffett has said he will likely never invest in the airline industry again.

In general, you should look for a profit margin above 20%. But again, every industry is different and it is important to compare profit margins between similar companies.

You should also consider the change in profit margin over time, as it can reveal whether earnings are growing because of increasing revenue or decreasing costs. When costs are cut, the profit margin, being the ratio of net income to revenue, will increase, and vice versa. It is great to see an increasing profit margin together with growing revenue as it indicates the company is both expanding and cutting costs.

On the other hand, if revenue is growing while profit margin is falling it means that costs are growing faster than revenue. Again, not all costs are bad. In this situation, you should find out what the company is spending money on. Is it something that supports the future growth of the business? If not, it could indicate that continued expansion of the business is unsustainable.

### Gross Margin

> Gross Margin = Gross Profit / Revenue

One measure of the efficiency of a company is gross margin. Gross margin measures how much money the company earns simply by selling its product before any indirect costs are subtracted.

As a reminder, gross profit is equal to sales minus the cost of goods sold (COGS), which includes things like labour and raw materials. If it is more expensive for a company to make and sell its product, the gross margin will be lower. For example, something like a pair of shoes may cost the business $30 to make in terms of material and wages. If they can sell those shoes for $100 they would have a gross margin of 70%.

The software industry has very high gross margins because it is very inexpensive to distribute its product after it is created (it only has to be developed once and is infinitely scalable). On the other hand, the auto industry has very low gross margins because of the significant amount of raw materials and labour involved in producing every single vehicle.

If a company is young it may not actually generate any income as it spends heavily on R&D and marketing. In these cases, earnings are negative and the profit margin is meaningless. This is where the gross margin can be helpful.

## Summary of Key Concepts
- The income statement shows the money that came into and out of the business during the period.
- Money trickles down from revenue at the top to net income at the bottom.
- Share price always follows earnings over the long-term.
- The PE ratio is a measure of the company's valuation relative to earnings per share. You should compare the PE ratio to that of companies in the same industry.
- The greater the expected growth, the higher the PE ratio will (or should) be.
- Short-term fluctuations in price can be thought of as expansions or contractions in the PE ratio according to investor sentiment.
- The PEG ratio allows us to measure valuation independent of growth. However, it only works if earnings is positive and growing.
- The profit margin measures how much the company keeps in earnings for every $1 in revenue. A high profit margin shows efficiency and provides a margin of safety in the event of an economic downturn.
