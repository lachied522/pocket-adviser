## Reading the Balance Sheet
### Debt to Equity (DE) Ratio

> Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Shareholder's Equity

The debt to equity ratio is widely considered the most important indicators of financial health. It measures the financial health by assessing the split between the two financing methods discussed above, debt and equity. It represents the portion of the company that belongs to its lenders versus its shareholders.

The word "debt" is used here as shorthand to refer to all liabilities rather than just borrowings. The Cambridge Dictionary defines debt as something that is owed to someone else, which applies to liabilities as well. However in this context, the person owed could be someone like a landlord or a lessor, not necessarily a lender. As far as I know, whether the word is being used to mean liabilities or borrowings is context-dependent, and there is no easy way of knowing when each one applies.

Companies must always pay their obligations no matter how much money they earn, so the greater the debt to equity ratio the more the company may struggle in an economic downturn. In extreme cases, if a company cannot pay its obligations it can go bankrupt.

The lower the debt to equity ratio the better. However, some industries, such as mining or manufacturing, involve large fixed assets which are appropriately borrowed rather than bought outright, in which case the ratio will naturally be higher. The consensus is that a DE ratio below 2.0 is safe, but I believe you should look for a ratio below 1.0.

### Cash to Total Debt Ratio

> Cash to Total Debt Ratio = Cash & Equivalents / Total Debt

The cash to total debt ratio is one of Warren Buffett's favourite metrics for measuring a company's financial health. It measures the company's debt level by comparing it to the current cash balance.

If the ratio is greater than 1.0, the company could pay off all of its debt immediately if it wanted to. This is an extremely healthy company since its debt level is completely manageable, even if the business didn't earn another dollar it wouldn't go bankrupt. This also shows a high level of flexibility, as the company can distribute cash to shareholders, reinvest in the business, or simply hold onto it for safety.

However, high cash to total debt ratios should be within reason. We know that some level of debt is okay because it increases shareholder returns through leverage. Additionally, once cash reaches a certain level of safety (such as 1:1 with total debt), investors like to see cash being used to grow the business or being returned to shareholders.

In saying this, company managers are generally aware of these concerns and know how best to deploy their cash. That's why I believe having high amounts of cash is pretty much always a good sign. You should look for cash to total debt ratios above 0.5.

### Price to Book (PB) ratio

> PB ratio = Share Price / Shareholder's Equity per Share

The price to book ratio is another valuation ratio, like the PE or PS ratio, except it has shareholder's equity in the denominator. As a quick reminder, shareholder's equity or book value is how much would be left over if all assets were sold and debts paid off. It provides a floor or minimum value for a company, because even if the company never earned another dollar it could unwind its books and realise its book value.

An advantage of the PB ratio is that it works for companies that don't make money. In the case when a company's earnings is negative (making the PE ratio useless), we can still use the PB ratio to determine whether the company is under or overpriced.

The PB ratio is also beneficial if a company's earnings fluctuate up and down, like in the financial and mineral industries. At the bottom of the economic cycle the earnings of these companies are at their lowest, so they appear more expensive relative to earnings and therefore seem like a poor investment. In reality, this is exactly when you want to buy these companies. Since a company's book value tends to stay relatively constant over time, the PB ratio can be used to get around these fluctuations.

In his famous book on value investing, The Intelligent Investor, first published in 1949, Benjamin Graham suggests looking for a PB ratio below 1.0. However, the figure above, which is the same from the previous chapter, shows that this figure is extremely far below any of the sector averages. Trading below 1.0 indicates that investors would literally be better off if the company ceased operations and unwound its books. This situation is extremely rare because, in general, businesses grow over time which provides value above and beyond the book value.

These days, you will rarely find a stock trading below a PB ratio of 1.0. I believe the explosion in technology since The Intelligent Investor was first published has significantly changed growth rates for companies and expectations of investors. Furthermore, because of the significant differences between market sectors, I don't believe there is an absolute figure you should look for in the PB ratio. You should use the PB ratio to compare companies within the same sector, or compare it to the PB ratio of the same company on a historical basis.

### Return on Equity (ROE)

> Return on Equity = Net Income / Shareholder's Equity

Return on equity (ROE) is another way to measure the efficiency of a company. 

Return on equity is important because it directly determines the company’s growth rate. It measures the company’s ability to generate a return and grow its shareholders’ equity, which in turn increases its stock price. For example, a company with a ROE of 30% generates $0.30 for every $1.00 in shareholders’ equity, and you can expect the company to grow by 30%.

Look for an ROE above 20%.

### Current Ratio

> Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities

While the DE ratio is a good measure of overall financial health, companies can still run into trouble if a large portion of liabilities are current, meaning due within the next 12-months. A more short-term measure of financial health is the current ratio. The current ratio measures the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations.

The lower the current ratio, the greater the portion of the company's income will have to spent on meeting its current obligations. This, is in turn, means the company faces greater financial risk if market conditions are unfavourable and the company doesn't earn enough.

However, if the current ratio is extremely high, for example 3.0 or above, it may indicate that the company is not utilising its assets efficiently.

> Tip - Look for a current ratio between 1.0 and 3.0.

### ​Other Things to Consider
One of the other things I like to look at on the balance sheet is how debt evolves over time. For example, if debt is stable or decreasing over time it is evident that it is within a level that is manageable by the company. On the other, if debt is consistently increasing over time it is an indicator that the business is not making enough money to cover interest payments. It's also possible that the business is simply relying on debt financing to expand its operations, in which case you would like to see revenue expanding at the same or faster pace then debt.

## Summary of Key Concepts
- The balance sheet shows the company's assets and liabilities at a particular point in time.
- An asset is something that is expected to generate a positive flow of money in the future, while a liability is expected to generate a negative flow.
- The debt to equity (DE) ratio measures the split between debt and equity financing. Companies with high DE ratios can benefit from leverage, which can magnify both shareholder returns and losses.
