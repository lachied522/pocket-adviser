## Tax
Tax is an important consideration in investing that is often overlooked by new investors. Money made in stocks is not free, and tax implications can have a material impact on your returns. There are also various discounts and benefits available which you can take advantage of to boost your returns.

Here we will discuss the general concepts of tax that you should be aware of. However, tax law changes over time and is different in every country, so the information provided should not be formally relied upon. You should make sure to become accustomed to the tax law of your own country.

Assuming you have no prior knowledge of how tax works I will provide a brief explanation. The amount of tax you pay is calculated on your **taxable income** which is the money you earned during the financial year from all sources, including your salary and investment gains, less allowable deductions. Your taxable income will determine which tax bracket you fall into and therefore how much tax you pay on each additional dollar earned. This is called your **marginal tax rate**.

Tax is calculated and payable at the end of the financial year. It is important to be aware of the tax incurred by your investments so you are not surprised by any tax liabilities at the end of the financial year.

Below are examples of the marginal tax systems from Australia and the United States. I recommend finding out what your personal marginal tax rate is to provide context for the rest of this section and inform some of the important decisions you will have to make on your investing journey.

## Capital Gains Tax (CGT)
When you sell a stock for more than you bought it, the profit you make is called a **capital gain**. If instead you sell a stock for less than you bought, it is called a **capital loss**. The capital gains and losses accross all your investments are added together to get your **net capital gain or loss**. If you have a net capital gain, it is added to your taxable income.

This means that if you make a large capital gain on one stock, you can sell another stock at a loss to reduce your net capital gain and therefore the amount of tax you pay at the end of the financial year. This strategy is called tax loss harvesting. This can provide incentive to sell stocks that you have lost money on, whether you expect them to recover or not.

If you end the financial year with a net capital loss, the tax benefit is not lost. Instead, the amount can be carried forward to be offset against any capital gains in future years.

> Key Concept - capital gains tax can be reduced by holding stocks for longer than 12 months (depending on the country).

In some countries, like the US and Australia, capital gains are taxed differently for investments held for longer than 12 months. In the US, long-term capital gains are taxed a reduced rate between 0% and 20%. In Australia, long-term capital gains incur a 50% tax discount.

These discounts are material, and should be kept in mind when deciding to sell an investment. For example, in Australia, if you have made $1000 on a stock that you have held for 11 months, your profit after tax will automatically jump from $810 to $905 if you hold it for just one more month (assuming your personal tax rates is 19%). This means it is often better to delay the decision to sell stocks that you have held for just under 12 months in order to receive the CGT discount. The significance of this discount increased with the amount of money invested and your personal tax rate.

## Dividends
Dividends, being your other source of income from investing in stocks, are also subject to tax. The tax treatment of dividends is very straightforward. The amount of the dividend is simply added to your taxable income and taxed at your marginal tax rate.

If you are enrolled in a dividend reinvestment plan, the dividend is obviously paid through additional shares, in which case there is no additional income to tax. Instead, the additional shares are said to be acquired for $0, which reduces your average purchase price and increases the amount of your capital gain when you ultimately decide to sell the holding.

## Franking or Imputation Credits
In Australia, investors receive franking credits with certain dividend payments that reduces the income tax paid on the dividend. The franking credit represents the amount in income tax that has already been paid by the company on its earnings. This is known as the imputation tax system, and is designed to eliminate double-taxation of corporate earnings (once on the corporate level and once on the individual level).

For example, a company earns $100,000 in income and pays $30,000 in income tax. It decides to return the $70,000 to its single shareholder via a dividend. A franking credit worth $30,000, equivalent to the tax paid by the company, is attached to the dividend. The shareholder is taxed on the dividend at their personal marginal tax rate, which ranges from 16% to 45% in Australia. If the shareholder's tax rate is greater than 30%, the personal tax payable is reduced by the full amount of the franking credit. If the shareholder's tax rate is less than 30%, the amount of the franking credit less personal tax payable is refunded to the shareholder.

## Summary of Key Concepts
- Capital gains tax (CGT) applies whenever you sell a stock.
- Capital gains and losses over the financial year are added together to get your net capital gain or loss. Capital losses can be carried forward to offset any capital gains in future tax years.
- Capital gains tax can be reduced by holding stocks for longer than 12 months (depending on the country).
- Dividends are classified as income and tax at your personal marginal tax rate.
In Australia, companies pay franking credits that act to offset your income tax.
