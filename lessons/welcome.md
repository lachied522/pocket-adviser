## Introduction

> *Any normal person using the customary three percent of the brain can pick stocks just as well, if not better, than the average Wall Street expert.*
> \- **Peter Lynch**, One Up On Wall Street

Welcome! The stock market is the greatest game you will ever play. Not only will you be playing against every other person in the market, you will be playing against yourself. It requires discipline, concentration, and emotional detachment (which is particularly difficult since money is involved).

Playing the game at all requires you to be above average. Outperforming the market, by definition, requires you to be - and if you do not outperform the market you may as well by an S&P500 Index fund and call it a day.

Though this may seem daunting, there is a silver lining. The traits required to be successful are not intellegence, wealth, or a finance degree. Anyone can become a winner.

## About Me

I started investing in my teens and have loved the stock market ever since. At the time of writing, I am 23 years old and have almost a decade of experience. I am a qualified financial adviser in Australia, and have worked in the industry for two years.

When I started in the stock market, my learning was self-lead and I didn't receive any finance training until university. I see that as a positive because I understand the obstacles and pitfalls new investors face when learning how to invest. I have made all the mistakes, and there are many, that you will likely make too. Throughout this course, I will present ideas in a way that I wish someone would have explained to me when I first started so that I could have avoided those mistakes or wasted less time on things that didn't work.

## Overview

This course will cover everything you need to know to become a successful investor in the stock market. I emphasise successful because of the requirement to be above average mentioned above. Every participant in the market (your competition) likely knows what a price to earnings ratio and simple moving average are. Knowing what these things are is great, but outperforming the market requires a higher level of understanding.

My goal for this course is to teach you everything you need to know about the stock market. But, because I don't wish to waste your time, I aim to teach you in a way that lands you squarely in the above average camp by the end.

We will start with an overview of the stock market and how it works, including the role of brokers and exchanges, the auction pricing process, and market and limit orders. This will provide you with the knowledge required to buy your first stock.

We will then move on to the Efficient Market Hypothesis and what it implies about the market. In this section we will discover how the market is driven by human emotion, and how that fact will shape our strategy over the rest of the course.

We will then discuss fundamental, technical, and macroanalysis, which will provide us with a methodology for picking stocks and timing when to buy them. We will find out what makes a good company, as well as how to measure fair value and identify when price deviates from it. We will learn how to identify trends and when they change, and how macroeconomic factors like inflation, interest rates, and GDP effect the market.

## Investing. Why bother?
I think it's appropriate to start this course by answering the above question. The answer to this question will provide a foundation for the concepts covered and give us an objective for the rest of the course.

If you are young like I was when I started investing (I still am young, but comparatively less so now) you likely don't have a lot to invest. Therefore, return you can expect to earn from investing is pretty low in dollar terms. For example, the average return of the S&P 500 is about 10%, so investing $1,000 will only return $100 in a year on average. Moreover, that $100 is not guaranteed and you also face the risk of losing money. So understandably, most young people simply don't bother investing.

For young investors, I would argue that the experience and knowledge you gain from investing at that stage is worth far more than the returns you can potentially make. The skills you learn can be applied later in life when you have much more to invest, at which point you will be miles ahead of everyone else.

But the real answer to the above question, and the single most important reason you want to invest no matter your stage of life, is compound interest. Called the eighth wonder of the world by Albert Einstein, compound interest is the multiplying effect that cumulative investments, like stocks, have on your wealth.

To see the power of compound interest, imagine I gave you two options:

Option A - $1.0 million in your pocket right now.

Option B - a single cent (that's $0.01) that doubles every day for one month.

A cent that doubles every day for a month? Pffft. It would take a week to turn into $1.00. No thank you!

If this was your line of reasoning, fair enough. If you chose option B, how much would you have at the end of those 31 days?

$21,474,836.48. That's $21 million.

Now, you're not going to double your money that quickly by investing in stocks. But investing in stocks does expose you to this kind of power. Let's use a more realistic example to demonstrate.

Imagine you are 20 years old and earn enough to put $500 aside each month to invest in an S&P500 index fund which returns 10% p.a. Sound reasonable?

At 33, you have pretty much doubled your money. At 50, you are a millionare. And at 60 you have $2,797,303.70.

I invite you to check out the calculator I used to make these calculations. Put in some numbers you are comfortable with and see what happens to your wealth!

This effect is also known as the snowball effect. Imagine a snowball rolling down a snowy mountain. In the beginning it grows slowly, but as it rolls down it gathers more and more snow as its surface area increases.

Obviously, compounding in the stock market is extremely slow. To make matters worse, it is extremely difficult to value large sums of money far into the future. As human beings, we make choices with emotions. The emotional benefit of spending $500 now is usually easy to measure. I know what I can buy and I now how it will make me feel. $1M in 30 years' time is a foreign concept for us, and its emotional benefit is blurry. This is a widely known phenomenon called temporal discounting.

This is why it is common for stock market courses to pedal "get rich quick" schemes that involve speculation and short-term trading. Future sums of money lose their appeal when compared to the promise of huge gains in the near-term. The problem with these strategies is that they are inconsistent and involve a high likelihood of losing money (we will discuss why in the next chapter). When you lose money compounding is undone, which has a signficant impact on your wealth over the long-term.

That brings us to our first quote from Warren Buffett, which summarises how important not losing money is to building long-term wealth.

> *The first rule of an investment is don’t lose money. And the second rule of an investment is don’t forget the first rule. And that’s all the rules there are.*
> \- **Warren Buffett**

Investing takes patience and requires you to adopt a long-term view in order to give the snowball effect time to work for you. By taking this course, you will learn how to consistently grow your wealth so that, subsequently, you can live at a level above that which could be achieved otherwise.
