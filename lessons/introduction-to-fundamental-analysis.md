## Introduction to Fundamental Analysis
When I was starting out in the market I frequently fell, subconsciously, into the notion that a stock was just a number that moved up and down on my computer screen. I found myself checking the number often, thinking “go up you darned thing!” In focusing on price, we lose sight of what it really is that we are buying. That is, a real company with products, customers, brands, employees, etc..

> *Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.*
\- **Warren Buffett**

This discrepancy between price and value is just like how the price tag on that cardigan you really want is different to the value the item holds for you. However, where the value of an item such as a cardigan can be measured by the enjoyment you might get out of wearing it, measuring the value of a whole company is more complex.

In finance, intrinsic value is the objective worth of an object, measured independently of all extraneous factors. It is one of the most important, yet elusive, concepts in investing. It is extremely difficult to measure precisely.

Market forces cause price to deviate, and in some cases, significantly, from intrinsic value. As these forces swing between positive and negative, price fluctuates around intrinsic value. In this way, intrinsic value acts like a magnet on price, pulling it up when it falls below and down when it rises above.

The deviation between price and intrinsic value is what determines the outcome of an investment. Because of it, the best companies in the world can make poor investments if purchased above intrinsic value. And poor companies can still make good investments if purchased below intrinsic value.

Fundamental analysis allows us to approximately measure this deviation between price and intrinsic value. By comparing price to intrinsic value, we can determine whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued and therefore whether we should buy or sell it. Furthermore, it can reveal traits that indicate whether the company is of high quality and one that we want to own in the first place.

Public companies are required by law to periodically release financial reports which inform the market about how the company is performing. The reports include an income statement, balance sheet, cashflow statement, and normally a little update from the CEO to investors. These reports are publicly available and can usually be found on the company’s website under “investor relations.”

In this section we will learn how to read each of the three main financial reports, as well as metrics or indicators we can use to assess fair value, financial health, and efficiency.
