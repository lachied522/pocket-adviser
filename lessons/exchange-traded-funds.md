## Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
Exchange-traded funds or ETFs are a popular way of investing in stocks that do not require any time or effort spent on the investor's behalf. To understand ETFs, imagine the following scenario.

Imagine you are at the market and need to buy fruit for a fruit salad, but you have never made a fruit salad before and have no experience buying fruit. You don't know which fruit to buy for your salad, let alone how to determine the quality of fruit from each stall to ensure you only select the best. Then, you stumble accross a stall that sells entire baskets containing different types fruit. The shop owner specialises in this sort of thing and has selected the best fruit for you, saving you the time and effort required to select the fruit yourself.

Now imagine you really want to invest in stocks, but you don't know how to select the ones that will make you the most money. There are thousands of stocks to choose from. Well, just like the fruit, you can buy the whole basket with an ETF.

Exchange-traded funds are investment funds that hold a group of underlying assets and can be bought and sold on exchanges just like individual stocks. ETFs can be **passively managed**, in which case the objective is to simply match the performance of an index, like the S&P 500, or they can be **actively managed**. In the latter case, professional investment managers will attempt to outperform a benchmark by actively buying and selling stocks in a way they believe is best.

ETFs can be broad, or focused on a particular sector or investment theme. For example, the [SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)](https://www.ssga.com/au/en_gb/intermediary/etfs/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy) is a broad, passive ETF that aims tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Index. On the other hand, the [iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (IWF)](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239706/ishares-russell-1000-growth-etf) is a passive ETF that focuses on stocks that exhibit growth qualities, which could be a better option for investors with a capital growth objective and a long time horizon. You can narrow down even further into particular investment themes, like the [Global X Artificial Intelligence ETF (GXAI)](https://www.globalxetfs.com.au/funds/gxai/) which focuses on stocks expected to benefit from AI.

The other advantage of ETFs is their cost. Every time you buy and sell individual stocks you incur a brokerage fee (which we will cover in more detail later). With an ETF, brokerage is only charged once to invest in anywhere from 100 to 1,000 underlying stocks. Instead, a small management fee is charged (the management for the SPY ETF is 0.09%), and is [simply incorporated into the return you make](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/071816/how-are-etf-fees-deducted.asp).

## ETFs vs Stocks
The reason I wanted to introduce you to ETFs so early in this course is because they are a highly sensible investment alternative to individual stocks. Whatever your objective, there is most likely an ETF that does exactly what you need. Every decision you make should be weighed against whether you would be better off simply buying an ETF.

For example, if I wanted to invest $10,000, I could spend time trying to select individual stocks that I expect to make the most money and constantly managing my portfolio thereafter. Or I could buy one actively managed ETF for $10,000, pay only one brokerage fee, and let a professional manage the portfolio for me.

In the chapter on the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), we will discuss how difficult it is to beat the market. In fact, because of how difficult it is, Warren Buffett believes that the best thing the average investor can do is [simply buy an S&P 500 Index fund](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-swears-index-funds-180009255.html) rather than attempt to select individual stocks.

If a hands-off, passive approach to investing appeals to you, then ETFs are simply your best choice. However, if you are taking this course, I assume you have at least some interest or curiosity about the market. As Peter Lynch says, any normal person can learn to pick stocks better than the average Wall Street expert. And, as I promised in the introduction to this course, we will cover everything you need to know to beat the market in the following chapters.

Once we know how to analyse stocks, we can start to specify the exact characteristics or traits of the ones we want to invest in. For example, out of the top holdings of the GXAI ETF above, maybe we don't want to be invested in Alibaba (BABA), Oracle (ORCL), or Cisco (CSCO). Maybe we know that Meta (META) or Amazon (AMZN) are leaders in AI technology and we want to invest a larger portion of our money in those. Nvidia (NVDA), which is arguably one of the biggest beneficiaries of AI, is not even in the top 10 holdings above.

That being said, there are still situations where I would recommend ETFs for active investors. In cases where you decide you want to invest in a particular sector or theme that is outside your **circle of competence** (e.g. I would consider the resources and pharmaceuticals sectors to be outside my circle of competence), you can buy an ETF to gain exposure while letting a professional manager look after it for you.

## Summary of Key Concepts
- ETFs provide a cheap investment alternative to individual stocks that involve much less time and effort on behalf of the investor.
- ETFs can be used to invest in themes or sectors that are outside your circle of competence.
