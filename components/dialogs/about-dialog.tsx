                            Hello! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
                            <br /><br />
                            My name is Lachie and I am the creator of Pocket Adviser, your AI stock market copilot.
                            <br /><br />
                            Financial advice is incredibly important for building the future you want for yourself. Unfortunately, the <b>cost of financial advice</b> has risen significantly in recent years, making it inaccessible to most young people.
                            <br /><br />
                            This means most people start their investing journey too late in life, leaving significant returns on the table due to the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/au/investing/compound-interest-in-australia/" target="_blank" className="underline text-sky-600">magic of compound interest</a>.
                            <br /><br />
                            Existing Robo Advisors solve this problem by offering managed investment portfolios. However, if you love the stock market, like me, this is no fun!
                            <br /><br />
                            I wanted to create a solution that utilises new AI technology for an <b>interactive</b> investing experience, and to act as a guide for other young investors.
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <H3>How It Works</H3>
                        <p>
                            Under the hood, Pocket Adviser uses a mathematical model to find an optimal portfolio of stocks based on a personalised utility function.
                            The utility function is a variation of the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treynorratio.asp" target="_blank" className="underline text-sky-600">Treynor Ratio</a>, which describes the expected excess return relative to risk.
                            Expected returns are taken from <b>consensus</b> analyst price targets.
                            <br /><br />
                            Pocket Adviser also has access to functions that allow it to search the web, read news articles, and retrieve stock data so that you can have an informed conversation.
                            <br />

                        <H3>About Me</H3>
                        <p>
                            I have Bachelor of Commerce and a Grad. Dip. of Financial Planning, and worked in the advice industry for two years.
                            <br /><br />
                            I hope you find Pocket Adviser helpful, and encourage you to reach out if you have any queries or feature requests!
